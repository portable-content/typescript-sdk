## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-23

### Added

#### Framework-Agnostic Rendering System (Task 5A)
- **VariantSelector**: Intelligent variant selection algorithm with:
  - Media type matching with wildcard support (`image/*`, `*/*`)
  - Quality scoring based on Accept headers with q-values
  - Format preference bonuses for modern formats (AVIF > WebP > JPEG)
  - Network-aware optimization (prefers smaller files on slow/cellular networks)
  - Capability hints integration (screen size, density, network type)
  - Fallback selection for graceful degradation

- **Renderer System**: Framework-agnostic rendering infrastructure with:
  - `BlockRenderer` interface with priority-based selection
  - `RenderContext` for passing capabilities and callbacks
  - `RenderResult` with content, variant, metadata, and error tracking
  - `DefaultRendererRegistry` with priority-ordered renderer management
  - Support for custom renderer registration and management

- **Content Processing**: Content optimization utilities with:
  - `DefaultContentProcessor` for preprocessing content before rendering
  - Variant optimization with best variant selection and fallbacks
  - Representation filtering for different content views (e.g., "summary")
  - Block-level processing with individual variant selection

- **Base Renderer Classes**: Abstract foundation classes with:
  - `BaseBlockRenderer` with common functionality and error handling
  - `BaseTextRenderer` specialized for text content with fetch utilities
  - `BaseImageRenderer` specialized for image content with dimension handling
  - Loading state management and consistent error handling

- **Capability Detection**: Automatic client capability detection with:
  - Media type support detection (WebP, AVIF, SVG)
  - Screen dimensions and pixel density detection
  - Network type detection (4G=FAST, 3G=SLOW, 2G=CELLULAR)
  - Interactive capability detection
  - Server-side safe with appropriate fallbacks

#### Core Infrastructure
- **TypeScript Types**: Comprehensive type definitions for:
  - Content items, blocks, and variants
  - Client capabilities and hints
  - Rendering interfaces and contexts
  - Network types and optimization hints

- **Base API Client**: Foundation for API communication with:
  - Abstract base client with common functionality
  - Error handling and response processing
  - Transport layer abstraction
  - Extensible architecture for different backends

#### Testing & Quality
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 95+ tests covering:
  - Unit tests for all rendering components
  - Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
  - Mock data factory for testing different scenarios
  - Edge case coverage and error handling validation

- **Code Quality Tools**: Development tooling with:
  - ESLint configuration with TypeScript support
  - Prettier formatting with consistent code style
  - Jest testing framework with coverage reporting
  - Rollup build system for optimized bundles

#### Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Complete documentation for:
  - All public interfaces and classes
  - Usage examples and integration guides
  - Type definitions and method signatures
  - Error handling and best practices

### Technical Details

#### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient variant selection algorithms
- Network-aware content optimization
- Minimal bundle size with tree-shaking support
- Lazy loading support for large content sets

#### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browser support (ES2020+)
- Server-side rendering (SSR) compatible
- Node.js environment support
- Framework-agnostic design (React Native, Vue, React Web ready)

#### Architecture Highlights
- **Zero UI Framework Dependencies**: Works with any frontend framework
- **Mock-First Development**: Complete functionality without backend dependencies
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Easy to add new block types and renderers
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with strict type checking
- **Error Resilient**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful fallbacks

### Development Workflow
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Code quality gates (linting, formatting, testing)
- Semantic versioning and automated releases
- Comprehensive test coverage requirements

## Release Notes

This initial release (v0.1.0) provides a complete foundation for the Portable Content System's TypeScript SDK. The framework-agnostic rendering system is production-ready and can be integrated with any UI framework.

### Next Steps
- Task 5: React Native Components (builds on this foundation)
- GraphQL Transport Implementation
- Vue.js and React Web renderer implementations
- Advanced caching and offline support

### Breaking Changes
None (initial release)

### Migration Guide
This is the initial release, so no migration is required.
